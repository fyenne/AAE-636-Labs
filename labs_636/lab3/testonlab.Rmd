You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(grid)
library(psych)
library(wooldridge)
library(BSDA)
describe(wage2)
attach(wage2)
data <- wage2
ybar <- mean(wage)
yvar <- sd(wage)#sample sd
xbar <- mean(educ)
xvar <- sd(educ)
yvar
```

---
```{r}
fit<-aov(educ~wage,data=data)
summary(fit)
1-fit$Pr
```

---
```{r}
lm.fit <- lm(formula = wage ~ educ, data = data)
#lm.fit2 <- lm(formula = wage ~ ., data = data)
# summary(lm.fit)
# Residual <- lm.fit$residuals
# Residual

```


<!-- pt(t,dof) = p -->
<!-- #双边要乘2 -->
<!-- qt(p,dof) = t -->
<!-- $\bigoplus$$\neq$ -->
